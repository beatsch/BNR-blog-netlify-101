        <p>The assessment of our page according to the WCAG 2.0 Guidelines </p>

        <h3 id="accessibility-highlights">Accessibility Highlights</h3>
        <p>Our Web page is accessible in terms of good contrast between the
        background and the text. This makes it possible for the majority of the
        visitors to visit our Web page without having any problems. Also, on our
        Web page purpose of the links can be determined by its name. This
        prevents visitors from clicking on a link and going to a different page
        than wanted.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Improvement Plan</h3>
        <h4>1. Perceivable</h4>
        <p><strong>1.1. Text Alternatives</strong><br>
        1.1.1. Non-text content<br>
        We should provide a text alternative for the header image. Furthermore,
        we should have used the &#x003C;alt&#x003E; attribute for the
        &#x003C;input&#x003E; which enhances the accessibility of our Web page
        and it helps to improve search engine optimization (<abbr>SEO</abbr>).</p>

        <p><strong>1.3 Adaptable</strong><br>
        1.3.1. Our Web Page would would have complied to guideline 1.3.1 if we
        would have had provided an alternative text for the header image since
        this is the only element that gets lost when using a different
        stylesheet or even better: not using header image. Instead, HTML and CSS
        can be used to make a simple logo which does still show up when another
        or no stylesheet is used. Also, making sure that structure of the page
        does not get lost (i.e. elements of the page not in the right place
        anymore) will make our page comply to guideline 1.3.1. <br>
        1.3.2. We can include in the "Number 1", "Number 2" and so on for each
        element in the ordered list and also leave out the
        <code>&#x003C;th&#x003E;</code> elements in the table in the footer,
        since they are not of real importance. The latter situation applies also
        on the table with the phones, because you cannot place a
        <code>&#x003C;td&#x003E;</code> element in a different column with a
        different heading. For instance, the screen size of the phone cannot
        be placed in a column which should contain the model of the phone.
        However, we cannot leave out those headings since they are important.
        Also, the order of the elements of the form is depends on the headers
        of the table and since we do not leave out those, we cannot change the
        order of the elements. However, if we would leave out the headers, then
        we could add labels to each field to make the elements independent from
        their order. Actually, we use have placeholders in the form fields, but
        the independency of the order of the elements cannot depend on those
        placeholders in our opinion.<br>
        1.3.3. We can solve the problem discussed in Appendix A by looking for
        phone images with the same sizes which does not have to be adjusted
        using CSS. Also, we have to make sure that the header image does not
        depend on its size or replace it by a simple text logo.</p>

        <p><strong>1.4. Distinguishable</strong><br>
        There are no further improvements needed to make our Web page more
        distinguishable as explained in Appendix A.</p>

        <h4>2. Operable</h4>
        <p><strong>2.1. Keyboard Accessible</strong><br>
        2.1.1. We should have made links and buttons navigable by keyboard by
        making use code with keyboard shortcuts and linking to this code to our
        HTML documents.</p>

        <p><strong>2.4. Navigable </strong><br>
        2.4.1. We do not have blocks of content repeated on multiple pages.
        However, if we would have had this, then we would have to find a way to
        make it possible to bypass. We could do this by using script which makes
        it possible to collapse and expand elements such as the header and the
        footer. Still, this criterion is not one we can use to base our
        judgement on of how navigable our site is.</p>


        2.4.2. The Web page has a title, so 2.4.2 complies to the Web page.<br>
        2.4.3. This criterion does not apply to our Web page, because our Web
        page cannot be navigated sequentially.<br>
        2.4.4. Although the links on our page do not link to existing pages, the
        purpose of each link on our Web page can be determined by the text only.
        Thus, our Web page complies to 2.4.4.<br>
        2.4.5. This does not apply to us, because we only have one Web page.<br>
        2.4.6. Each section of our Web page has a title or heading.<br>

                  1.1.1.Our Web page does unfortunately not provide text
                  alternatives that serve the equivalent purpose for most of the
                  non-text content. Our Web Page contains a header image and
                  input fields.

                <td>
                    1.3.1. Except for the header image, the information does not
                    get lost when using another stylesheet. Using no style
                    sheet, no information gets lost, however the sidebar,
                    navigation bar, top bar and the main body are not in correct
                    order anymore. We can conclude that no information gets
                    lost, but the structure does.<br>
                    1.3.2. We have a lot unordered lists of which the meaning
                    does not rely on the order of the list. However, we have one
                    ordered list. The meaning of this list does rely on the
                    order of it elements. We also have two table in the for
                    which the order of the <code>&#x003C;td&#x003E;</code>
                    elements matter (i.e. in which column they are placed). We
                    have forms to filter the results of the webshop, to rate our
                    page and to add new phones to the webshop. The order of the
                    elements is important for the latter form as the order
                    depends on the table headers which we cannot leave out.<br>
                    1.3.3. Our Web page content does not solely rely on sensory
                    characteristic, except for two things. First of all, size of
                    the header image depends on size, but it does not affect the
                    experience of visiting the Web page. Secondly, the sizes of
                    the phone images matter a lot. If the sylesheet would not
                    define the define the size of the images, then it would
                    cause the size of two of the three images to affect the
                    experience of visiting the Web page heavily in a negative
                    way. But, shape, visual location, orientation or sound do
                    not affect the user experience when visiting our Web page.

                    1.4.1. Our Web Page does not rely on colour and the
                    foreground and background are easily distinguishable from
                    each other. Also, all elements of the body (i.e. the
                    sidebar, the main, the header and the footer) provide enough
                    contrast between the text colour and the background colour.
                    Therefore our Web page is readable for people with colour
                    deficits. We made sure that this is the case by using an

                    1.4.2. Since our page does not have audio content, users

                    whole page and each element. This problem is caused by links
                    and buttons that cannot be selected using only the keyboard.<br>
                    2.1.2. This criterion does not apply to our Web page as it
                    is not keyboard accessible.<br>
